## About:
Web Developer and Front-End Engineer specialized in technologies such as Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Continuously refining skills in React Native and back-end development (Node.js, Nest.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Prisma ORM) to deliver scalable and integrated fullstack solutions.

Founder of Konbini Code, where I create modern, responsive websites ranging from landing pages to micro e-commerce stores. I manage projects end-to-end with a strong focus on clean code, performance optimization, and mobile-first design principles.

With over 10 years living in Japan, I bring a multicultural perspective combined with a deep commitment to delivering excellent user experiences. Always curious and dedicated to continuous learning, I stay up to date with the latest technologies and industry best practices.
